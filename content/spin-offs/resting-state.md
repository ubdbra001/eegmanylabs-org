# Resting State (#EEGML:RS)

**What is the #EEGML:RS?**

This is a spin-off from #EEGManyLabs with the aim of leveraging these data collection plans to collect additional resting state data that can be openly shared amongst our community and used to provide additional insights above and beyond the core programme of work.

**What are the aims of the #EEGML:RS?**

- To create the world's largest open dataset of EEG resting state.
- We believe that there is enormous value that could be gained from the availability of such a dataset- from providing a detailed characterisation of resting state across the population and contrasting with patient populations and mapping developmental trajectories to answering theoretical questions on the nature of the signal and its relationship with task-related activity.

**What are the benefits of participating in the #EEGML:RS?**

- You will be offered co-authorship on #EEGManyLab spin-offs that make use of these data. For example, the most immediate publication will involve a conceptual replication tackling an age-old question on the relationship between frontal asymmetry and personality measures (which will be submitted to Cortex like other #EEGManyLabs papers). You can read more about that analysis [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137hb1Y-6Gw_nnu3u_QlSY4Fa6GgkQa8pPZ1WewYK9ns/edit?usp=sharing).
- You could use the dataset that will be generated for your own projects.
- Through making the data publicly available, you will contribute to improving the quality of EEG resting state research.

**What do I need to do if my replication group wants to participate?**

- You will have to record an 8-minute EEG-Resting State sequence and ask participants to fill out some standard questionnaires (15-20 min).
- Please refer to the [onboarding tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxR57Is4AI8g-hNkECgUxxakWxgi54kU0jfWX8gbs84/edit) for a more-detailed protocol
- If you have any further questions, please add your comments to the protocol, or email us at [sebastian.ocklenburg@ruhr-uni-bochum.de](mailto:sebastian.Ocklenburg@ruhr-uni-bochum.de) or [pavlovug@gmail.com](mailto:pavlovug@gmail.com)
