<p>In the phenomenon of attentional blink, identical visual stimuli are sometimes fully perceived and sometimes not detected at all. This phenomenon thus provides an optimal situation to study the fate of stimuli not consciously perceived and the differences between conscious and nonconscious processing. We correlated behavioral visibility ratings and recordings of event-related potentials to study the temporal dynamics of access to consciousness. Intact early potentials (P1 and N1) were evoked by unseen words, suggesting that these brain events are not the primary correlates of conscious perception. However, we observed a rapid divergence around 270 ms, after which several brain events were evoked solely by seen words. Thus, we suggest that the transition toward access to consciousness relates to the optional triggering of a late wave of activation that spreads through a distributed network of cortical association areas.</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#kgloy">Kilian Gloy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We examined the neurocognitive correlates of the Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Activation Systems (BIS/BAS) in an effort to clarify ambiguities concerning interpretations of BIS as reflecting inhibition versus avoidance. We hypothesized that self-reported BIS should relate to neural mechanisms associated with conflict monitoring, whereas self-reported BAS should be associated with neural correlates of approach motivation. Consistent with these predictions, higher self-reported BIS was uniquely related to the N2 event-related potential on No-Go trials of a Go/No-Go task, linking BIS with conflict monitoring and sensitivity to No-Go cues. Higher BAS was uniquely related to greater left-sided baseline frontal cortical asymmetry associated with approach orientation. Implications for theories of self-regulation involving conflict monitoring, cognitive control, and approach/avoidance motivation are discussed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this study we examined whether the effects of mental fatigue on behaviour are due to reduced action monitoring as indexed by the error related negativity (Ne/ERN), N2 and contingent negative variation (CNV) event-related potential (ERP) components. Therefore, we had Subjects perform a task, which required a high degree of action monitoring, continuously for 2 h. In addition we tried to relate the observed behavioural and electrophysiological changes to motivational processes and individual differences. Changes in task performance due to fatigue were accompanied by a decrease in Ne/ERN and N2 amplitude, reflecting impaired action monitoring, as well as a decrease in CNV amplitude which reflects reduced response preparation with increasing fatigue. Increasing the motivational level of our subjects resulted in changes in behaviour and brain activity that were different for individual subjects. Subjects that increased their performance accuracy displayed an increase in Ne/ERN amplitude, while subjects that increased their response speed displayed an increase in CNV amplitude. We will discuss the effects prolonged task performance on the behavioural and physiological indices of action monitoring, as well as the relationship between fatigue, motivation and individual differences.

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#nsrinivasan">Narayanan Srinivasan</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An important effect of sustained attention is the facilitation of perception. Although the term \sustained\" suggests that this beneficial effect endures continuously as long as something is attended, we present electrophysiological evidence that perception at attended locations is actually modulated periodically. Subjects detected brief light flashes that were presented peripherally at locations that were either attended or unattended. We analyzed the correlation between detection performance for attended and unattended stimuli and the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations, which relate to subsecond fluctuations of neuronal excitability. Although on average, detection performance was improved by attention-indicated by reduced detection thresholds at attended locations-we found that detection performance for attended stimuli actually fluctuated over time along with the phase of spontaneous oscillations in the. (approximate to 7 Hz) frequency band just before stimulus onset. This fluctuation was absent for unattended stimuli. This pattern of results suggests that \"sustained\" attention in fact exerts its facilitative effect on perception in a periodic fashion."</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#nburra">Nicolas Burra</a></p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/CuEbtTJH9PUGJbND8">Sign-up form</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We investigated the capability of emotional and nonemotional visual stimulation to capture automatic attention, an aspect of the interaction between cognitive and emotional processes that has received scant attention from researchers. Event-related potentials were recorded from 37 subjects using a 60-electrode array, and were submitted to temporal and spatial principal component analyses to detect and quantify the main components, and to source localization software (LORETA) to determine their spatial origin. Stimuli capturing automatic attention were of three types: emotionally positive, emotionally negative, and nonemotional pictures. Results suggest that initially (P1: 105 msec after stimulus), automatic attention is captured by negative pictures, and not by positive or nonemotional ones. Later (P2: 180 msec), automatic attention remains captured by negative pictures, but also by positive ones. Finally (N2: 240 msec), attention is captured only by positive and nonemotional stimuli. Anatomically, this sequence is characterized by decreasing activation of the visual association cortex (VAC) and by the growing involvement, from dorsal to ventral areas, of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Analyses suggest that the ACC and not the VAC is responsible for experimental effects described above. Intensity, latency, and location of neural activity related to automatic attention thus depend clearly on the stimulus emotional content and on its associated biological importance.

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#akeil">Andreas Keil</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effects of spatial selective attention on sensory processing in visual cortical areas were investigated by means of visual evoked potential (VEP) recordings and source localization techniques. Patterned stimuli were rapidly presented in random order to the left and right visual fields while subjects maintained central fixation and attended to one visual field at a time. Attended stimuli evoked enhanced P1 (100-130 msec) and N1 (120-200 msec) components of the VEP, whereas no effects of attention were observed on the C1 (50-100 msec) or P2 (200-240 msec) components. Spatiotemporal dipole modeling of the early VEP sources was carried out in relation to MRI-defined cortical anatomy. The dipolar generator of the CI component was found to lie in calcarine cortex, the human homologue of area Vl,whereas the attention-sensitive P1 generator was localized to ventral-lateral occipital cortex, within extrastriate area 19. These results support the hypothesis that spatial attention does not affect the initial activity evoked in area V1 but rather produces an enhancement within extrastriate visual areas of sensory signals arising from stimuli at attended locations.</p>

<h2><a name="DelCul2007"> Brain Dynamics Underlying the Nonlinear Threshold for Access to Consciousness</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#kdesender">Kobe Desender </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a flashed stimulus is followed by a backward mask, subjects fail to perceive it unless the target-mask interval exceeds a threshold duration of about 50 ms. Models of conscious access postulate that this threshold is associated with the time needed to establish sustained activity in recurrent cortical loops, but the brain areas involved and their timing remain debated. We used high-density recordings of event- related potentials (ERPs) and cortical source reconstruction to assess the time course of human brain activity evoked by masked stimuli and to determine neural events during which brain activity correlates with conscious reports. Target- mask stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was varied in small steps, allowing us to ask which ERP events show the characteristic nonlinear dependence with SOA seen in subjective and objective reports. The results separate distinct stages in mask-target interactions, indicating that a considerable amount of subliminal processing can occur early on in the occipito-temporal pathway (&lt; 250 ms) and pointing to a late (&gt;270 ms) and highly distributed fronto-parieto-temporal activation as a correlate of conscious reportability.</p>

<p><a href="not opened for signing-up yet (stay tuned!)">Sign-up form</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The functional significance of the N2 in go/no-go tasks was investigated by comparing electrophysiological data obtained from two tasks: a go/no-go task involving both response inhibition as well as response conflict monitoring, and a go/GO task associated with conflict monitoring only. No response was required to no-go stimuli, and a response with maximal force to GO stimuli. The relative frequency of the go stimuli (80% vs. 50%) was varied. The N2 peaked on both no-go and GO trials, with larger amplitudes for both signals when presented in a context of frequent (80%) go signals. These results support the idea that the N2 reflects conflict monitoring not response inhibition. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#gganis">Giorgio Ganis</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Event-related potentials were measured to letters presented either to the left or the right of a fixation point that were preceded by a precue that indicated the position of the upcoming letter either correctly (valid trials) or incorrectly (invalid trials). One letter required a response (Go stimulus), while the other letter required no response (Nogo stimulus). In experiment I, Nogo letters occurred only on 25% of the trials, while in experiment II, Go and Nogo letters were equiprobable. In both experiments, Nogo stimuli elicited larger N2 components and P3s with a more anterior topography than did Go stimuli. The N2 enhancement elicited by Nogo stimuli showed a frontal maximum (most markedly when Go and Nogo stimuli were equiprobable) and was significantly influenced by precue validity. These results are discussed in terms of ''Response Mismatch'' and action inhibition processes.</p>

<h2><a name="Eimer1996"> The N2pc component as an indicator of attentional selectivity. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#hliesefeld">Heinrich Liesefeld</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during visual discrimination tasks in which stimulus arrays were presented that contained one lateral target and 3 (experiment 1) or one (experiments 2 and 3) non-targets. In experiments 1 and 2, targets differed from non-targets with respect to their form or their color. In experiment 3, word pairs were presented, with targets differing from non-targets with respect to their content. Subjects were required to respond to the identity of the target. In all experiments, an enhanced negativity was elicited at posterior electrodes contralateral to the location of the target. In the form discrimination tasks, this effect was present in the N1, N2, and P3 time intervals. In the color discrimination tasks, it was confined to the N2 time range. In the word discrimination task (experiment 3), this effect could only be observed over the left posterior hemisphere. It is argued that these lateralized negativities reflect the N2pc component that is assumed to indicate attentional filtering processes during visual search tasks. The present results extend this assumption by showing that this component is also elicited when targets are presented together with just one non-target item. It is argued that the N2pc may reflect the attentional selection of task-relevant stimuli.</p>

<h2><a name="Eimer2003"> The role of spatial attention in the processing of facial expression: An ERP study of rapid brain responses to six basic emotions</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#xhe">Xun He</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To investigate the time course of emotional expression processing, we recorded ERP responses to stimulus arrays containing neutral versus angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, or surprised faces. In one half of the experiment, the task was to discriminate emotional and neutral facial expressions. Here, an enhanced early frontocentral positivity was elicited in response to emotional as opposed to neutral faces, followed by a broadly distributed positivity and an enhanced negativity at lateral posterior sites. These emotional expression effects were very similar for all six basic emotional expressions. In the other half of the experiment, attention was directed away from the faces to ward a demanding perceptual discrimination task. Under these conditions, emotional expression effects were completely eliminated, demonstrating that brain processes involved in the detection and analysis of facial expression require focal attention. The face-specific N170 component was unaffected by any emotional expression, supporting the hypothesis that structural encoding and expression analysis are independent processes.</p>

<h2><a name="Frank2005"> Error-Related Negativity Predicts Reinforcement Learning and Conflict Biases</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#achatard">Armand Chatard</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The error-related negativity (ERN) is an electrophysiological marker thought to reflect changes in dopamine when participants make errors in cognitive tasks. Our computational model further predicts that larger ERNs should be associated with better learning to avoid maladaptive responses. Here we show that participants who avoided negative events had larger ERNs than those who were biased to learn more from positive outcomes. We also tested for effects of response conflict on ERN magnitude. While there was no overall effect of conflict, positive learners had larger ERNs when having to choose among two good options (win/win decisions) compared with two bad options (lose/lose decisions), whereas negative learners exhibited the opposite pattern. These results demonstrate that the ERN predicts the degree to which participants are biased to learn more from their mistakes than their correct choices and clarify the extent to which it indexes decision conflict.</p>

<h2><a name="Hajcak2003"> Anxiety and error-related brain activity</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#everona">Edelyn Verona</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error-related negativity (ERN/Ne) is a component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) associated with monitoring action and detecting errors. It is a sharp negative deflection that generally occurs from 50 to 150 ms following response execution and has been associated with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity. An enhanced ERN has been observed in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-reflecting abnormal ACC activity hypothesized as part of the pathophysiology of OCD. We recently reported that the ERN is also enhanced in a group of college students with OC characteristics. The present study extended these findings by measuring the ERN in college undergraduates who scored high on either the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) or a combined version of the Snake (SNAQ) and Spider (SPQ) Questionnaires. Results indicate that, like OC subjects, subjects who score high on a measure of general anxiety and worry have enhanced error-related brain activity relative to both phobic and non-anxious control subjects. The enhanced ERN was found to generalize beyond OCD within the anxiety spectrum disorders but also shows some specificity within these disorders. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>

<h2><a name="Hajcak2006"> The feedback-related negativity reflects the binary evaluation of good versus bad outcomes</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#mvandermolen">Melle van der Molen </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electrophysiological studies have utilized event-related brain potentials to study neural processes related to the evaluation of environmental feedback. In particular, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) has been shown to reflect the evaluation of monetary losses and negative performance feedback. Two experiments were conducted to examine whether or not the FRN is sensitive to the magnitude of negative feedback. In both experiments, participants performed simple gambling tasks in which they could receive a range of potential outcomes on each trial. Relative to feedback indicating monetary gain, feedback indicating non-rewards was associated with a FRN in both experiments; however, the magnitude of the FRN did not demonstrate sensitivity to the magnitude of non-reward in either experiment. These data suggest that the FRN reflects the early appraisal of feedback based on a binary classification of good versus bad outcomes. These data are discussed in terms of contemporary theories of the FRN, as well as appraisal processes implicated in emotional processing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related potential that is maximal approximately 50 ms after the commission of an error. The ERN is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the medial prefrontal cortex implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. Affective and motivational variables influence the magnitude of the ERN, which suggests that the ERN may relate to emotional or motivational aspects of error detection. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the ERN may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors. We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors. Thus, response errors prime defensive motivation-and the ERN predicts individual differences in the aversive response to errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related brain potential observed when subjects receive feedback indicating errors or monetary losses. Evidence suggests that the ERN is larger for unexpected negative feedback. The P300 has also been shown to be enhanced for unexpected feedback, but does not appear to be sensitive to feedback valence. The present study evaluated the role of expectations on the ERN and P300 in two experiments that manipulated the probability of negative feedback (25%, 50%, or 75%) on a trial-by-trial basis in experiment 1, and by varying the frequency of positive and negative feedback across blocks of trials in experiment 2. In both experiments, P300 amplitude was larger for unexpected feedback; however, the ERN was equally large for expected and unexpected negative feedback. These results are discussed in terms of the potential role of expectations in processing errors and negative feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related brain potential observed when subjects commit errors. To examine whether the ERN is sensitive to the value of errors, the motivational significance of errors was manipulated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, low and high monetary value errors were compared to evaluate the effect of trial value on the ERN. In Experiment 2, subjects performed a flanker task both while their performance was being evaluated and during a control condition. Consistent with the notion that the error-detection system is sensitive to the significance of errors, the ERN was significantly larger on high-value trials in Experiment 1 and during evaluation in Experiment 2. There were no corresponding effects on the correct response negativity, and no behavioral differences between conditions were evident in either experiment. These results are discussed in terms of the functional role of the ERN in response monitoring.</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#amacnamara">Annmarie MacNamara</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people derive peace of mind and purpose in life from their belief in God. For others, however, religion provides unsatisfying answers. Are there brain differences between believers and nonbelievers? Here we show that religious conviction is marked by reduced reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cortical system that is involved in the experience of anxiety and is important for self-regulation. In two studies, we recorded electroencephalographic neural reactivity in the ACC as participants completed a Stroop task. Results showed that stronger religious zeal and greater belief in God were associated with less firing of the ACC in response to error and with commission of fewer errors. These correlations remained strong even after we controlled for personality and cognitive ability. These results suggest that religious conviction provides a framework for understanding and acting within one's environment, thereby acting as a buffer against anxiety and minimizing the experience of error.  </p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/PP2SqQ5N49KLQHxb6">Sign-up form</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>AFTER the detection of a target item in a rapid stream of visual stimuli, there is a period of 400-600 ms during which subsequent targets are missed. This impairment has been labelled the 'attentional blink'(1). It has been suggested that, unlike an eye blink, the additional blink does not reflect a suppression of perceptual processing, but instead reflects a loss of information at a postperceptual stage, such as visual short-term memory(2-4). Here we provide electrophysiological evidence that words presented during the attentional blink period are analysed to the point of meaning extraction, even though these extracted meanings cannot be reported 1-2 s later. This shows that the attentional blink does indeed reflect a loss of information at a postperceptual stage of processing, and provides a demonstration of the modularity of human brain function.</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#mruzzoli">Manuela Ruzzoli</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We often fail to see something that at other times is readily detectable. Because the visual stimulus itself is unchanged, this variability in conscious awareness is likely related to changes in the brain. Here we show that the phase of EEG alpha rhythm measured over posterior brain regions can reliably predict both subsequent visual detection and stimulus-elicited cortical activation levels in a metacontrast masking paradigm. When a visual target presentation coincides with the trough of an alpha wave, cortical activation is suppressed as early as 100 ms after stimulus onset, and observers are less likely to detect the target. Thus, during one alpha cycle lasting 100 ms, the human brain goes through a rapid oscillation in excitability, which directly influences the probability that an environmental stimulus will reach conscious awareness. Moreover, ERPs to the appearance of a fixation cross before the target predict its detection, further suggesting that cortical excitability level may mediate target detection. A novel theory of cortical inhibition is proposed in which increased alpha power represents a \pulsed inhibition\" of cortical activity that affects visual awareness."</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#mgamer">Matthias Gamer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different regions of the brain must communicate with each other to provide the basis for the integration of sensory information, sensory-motor coordination and many other functions that are critical for learning, memory, information processing, perception and the behaviour of organisms. Hebb1 suggested that this is accomplished by the formation of assemblies of cells whose synaptic linkages are strengthened whenever the cells are activated or ‘ignited’ synchronously. Hebb's seminal concept has intrigued investigators since its formulation, but the technology to demonstrate its existence had been lacking until the past decade. Previous studies have shown that very fast electroencephalographic activity in the gamma band (20–70 Hz) increases during, and may be involved in, the formation of percepts and memory2,3,4,5,6, linguistic processing7, and other behavioural and preceptual functions8,9,10,11,12. We show here that increased gamma-band activity is also involved in associative learning. In addition, we find that another measure, gamma-band coherence, increases between regions of the brain that receive the two classes of stimuli involved in an associative-learning procedure in humans. An increase in coherence could fulfil the criteria required for the formation of hebbian cell assemblies1, binding together parts of the brain that must communicate with one another in order for associative learning to take place. In this way, coherence may be a signature for this and other types of learning.</p>

<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#rnaar">Richard Naar</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By voluntarily directing attention to a specific region of a visual scene, we can improve our perception of stimuli at that location(1). This ability to focus attention upon specific zones of the visual field has been described metaphorically as a moveable spotlight or zoom lens that facilitates the processing of stimuli within its 'beam'(2,3). A long-standing controversy has centred on the question of whether the spotlight of spatial attention has a unitary beam or whether it can be divided flexibly to disparate locations(2,4-6). Evidence supporting the unitary spotlight view has come from numerous behavioural(3,7-10) and electrophysiological(11,12) studies. Recent experiments, however, indicate that the spotlight of spatial attention may be divided between noncontiguous zones of the visual field for very brief stimulus exposures (&lt;100 ms)(13,14). Here we use an electrophysiological measure of attentional allocation (the steady-state visual evoked potential) to show that the spotlight may be divided between spatially separated locations (excluding interposed locations) over more extended time periods. This spotlight division appears to be accomplished at an early stage of visual-cortical processing.</p>

<h2><a name="Onton2005"> Frontal midline EEG dynamics during working memory</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#sgregory">Samantha Gregory</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We show that during visual working memory, the electroencephalographic (EEG) process producing 5-7 Hz frontal midline theta (fm theta) activity exhibits multiple spectral modes involving at least three frequency bands and a wide range of amplitudes. The process accounting for the fm theta increase during working memory was separated from 71-channel data by clustering on time/frequency transforms of components returned by independent component analysis (ICA). Dipole models of fm theta component scalp maps were consistent with their generation in or near dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. From trial to trial, theta power of fm theta components varied widely but correlated moderately with theta power in other frontal and left temporal processes. The weak mean increase in frontal midline theta power with increasing memory load, produced entirely by the fm theta components, largely reflected progressively stronger theta activity in a relatively small proportion of trials. During presentations of letter series to be memorized or ignored, fm theta components also exhibited 1215 Hz low-beta activity that was stronger during memorized than during ignored letter trials, independent of letter duration. The same components produced a brief 3-Hz burst 500 ms after onset of the probe letter following each letter sequence. A new decomposition method, log spectral ICA, applied to normalized log time/frequency transforms of fm theta component Memorize-letter trials, showed that their low-beta activity reflected harmonic energy in continuous, sharppeaked theta wave trains as well as independent low-beta bursts. Possibly, the observed fm theta process variability may index dynamic adjustments in medial frontal cortex to trial-specific behavioral context and task demands. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

<h2><a name="Sergent2005"> Timing of the brain events underlying access to consciousness during the attentional blink</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#dcruse">Damian Cruse</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the phenomenon of attentional blink, identical visual stimuli are sometimes fully perceived and sometimes not detected at all. This phenomenon thus provides an optimal situation to study the fate of stimuli not consciously perceived and the differences between conscious and nonconscious processing. We correlated behavioral visibility ratings and recordings of event-related potentials to study the temporal dynamics of access to consciousness. Intact early potentials (P1 and N1) were evoked by unseen words, suggesting that these brain events are not the primary correlates of conscious perception. However, we observed a rapid divergence around 270 ms, after which several brain events were evoked solely by seen words. Thus, we suggest that the transition toward access to consciousness relates to the optional triggering of a late wave of activation that spreads through a distributed network of cortical association areas.</p>

<h2><a name="Vidal2000"> Is the ‘error negativity’ specific to errors?</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#chassall">Cameron Hassall</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When subjects make an erroneous response in a choice reaction time task, an error negativity, or error-related negativity (N(E)/ERN), peaking at about 100 ms after EMG onset, has been described. This wave is often considered to be absent on correct response trials. We report a small N(E)/ERN wave on correct response trials during a choice reaction time task in which surface Laplacians were estimated by the source derivation method. This wave is well focused at FCz, and its time course is the same for correct responses trials, incorrect sub-threshold EMG activation trials, and error trials. Current source density maps, also indicate a focus at FCz. A second experiment showed the existence of a N(E), at FCz on correct trials during a simple RT task. Rather than an error detection process per se, we propose that the N(E)/ERN reflects either a comparison process leading secondarily to error detection, or an emotional reaction.

<h2><a name="VogelMachizawa2004"> Neural activity predicts individual differences in visual working memory capacity</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#nlanger">Nicolas Langer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to our rich phenomenological visual experience, our visual short-term memory system can maintain representations of only three to four objects at any given moment(1,2). For over a century, the capacity of visual memory has been shown to vary substantially across individuals, ranging from 1.5 to about 5 objects(3-7). Although numerous studies have recently begun to characterize the neural substrates of visual memory processes(8-12), a neurophysiological index of storage capacity limitations has not yet been established. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for lateralized activity in humans that reflects the encoding and maintenance of items in visual memory. The amplitude of this activity is strongly modulated by the number of objects being held in the memory at the time, but approaches a limit asymptotically for arrays that meet or exceed storage capacity. Indeed, the precise limit is determined by each individual's memory capacity, such that the activity from low-capacity individuals reaches this plateau much sooner than that from high-capacity individuals. Consequently, this measure provides a strong neurophysiological predictor of an individual's capacity, allowing the demonstration of a direct relationship between neural activity and memory capacity.</p>

<h2><a name="YeungSanfey2004"> Independent Coding of Reward Magnitude and Valence in the Human Brain</h2>
<p>Lead by <a href="/people/#fmushtaq">Faisal Mushtaq</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous research has shown that two components of the event-related brain potential, the P300 and feedback negativity, are sensitive to information about rewards and penalties. The present study investigated the properties of these components in a simple gambling game that required participants to choose between cards that were unpredictably associated with monetary gains and losses of variable magnitude. The aim was to determine the sensitivity of each component to two critical features of reward stimuli: magnitude ( small or large) and valence ( win or loss). A double dissociation was observed, with the P300 sensitive to reward magnitude but insensitive to reward valence and the feedback negativity showing the opposite pattern, suggesting that these two fundamental features of rewarding stimuli are evaluated rapidly and separately in the human brain. Subsequent analyses provided additional evidence of functional dissociations between the feedback negativity and P300. First, the P300 ( but not the feedback negativity) showed sensitivity to the reward value of alternative, nonselected stimuli. Second, individual differences in the amplitude of the feedback negativity correlated with individual differences in risk-taking behavior observed after monetary losses, whereas individual differences in P300 amplitude were related to behavioral adjustments observed in response to alternative, unchosen outcomes.</p>
